# Fantasy Novel Writing System v3.0 - User Guide

## üöÄ Getting Started

### System Requirements
- Claude Code or compatible AI agent platform
- Terminal/command line access
- Python 3.6+ (for monitoring dashboard)
- Sufficient storage space (recommended: 500MB minimum)

### Quick Start (60 Seconds)

1. **Initialize the System**
   ```bash
   ./launch-novel.sh
   ```

2. **Start Novel Generation**
   ```bash
   claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --continue
   ```

3. **Monitor Progress** (Optional)
   ```bash
   python3 automation/dashboard.py --monitor
   ```

That's it! The system will now autonomously generate a complete 100,000-word fantasy novel.

## üìã Detailed Setup Guide

### Step 1: Project Initialization

Run the launch script to set up the complete project structure:

```bash
./launch-novel.sh
```

This script will:
- Create all necessary directories
- Initialize progress tracking files
- Set up world and character state files
- Configure the monitoring system
- Prepare the launch environment

### Step 2: System Verification

After initialization, verify the project structure:

```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ worldbuilding/               # ‚úÖ World state
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ characters/                  # ‚úÖ Character tracking
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ automation/                  # ‚úÖ Monitoring tools
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Documentation/               # ‚úÖ This guide
```

### Step 3: Novel Generation Launch

Start the autonomous generation process:

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --continue -p "You are the MASTER ORCHESTRATOR. Read CLAUDE.md for your complete instructions. Begin autonomous novel generation immediately."
```

**Important Notes:**
- The `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag is required for autonomous operation
- The system will run continuously until the novel is complete
- No human intervention is needed or expected

## üìä Monitoring Your Novel

### Real-Time Dashboard

Launch the monitoring dashboard to track progress:

```bash
# One-time status check
python3 automation/dashboard.py

# Continuous monitoring (refreshes every 30 seconds)
python3 automation/dashboard.py --monitor

# Custom refresh interval
python3 automation/dashboard.py --monitor --interval 60
```

### Dashboard Features

The monitoring dashboard displays:
- **Progress Overview**: Word count, completion percentage, target progress
- **Chapter Status**: Individual chapter completion states
- **Current Activity**: What the system is currently working on
- **File System Status**: Verification of all system components
- **Timeline**: Progress over time

### Manual Progress Checking

You can also check progress manually by examining key files:

```bash
# Current progress
cat planning/plot-progress.json

# Chapter status
cat planning/chapter-status.json

# Word count in manuscript
find manuscript/chapters -name "*.md" -exec wc -w {} + | tail -n 1
```

## üéØ Understanding System Behavior

### The Autonomous Generation Process

The system operates in a continuous loop:

1. **Assessment Phase**
   - Reads current progress from `/planning/plot-progress.json`
   - Analyzes chapter status and word counts
   - Evaluates story pacing and structure needs

2. **Decision Phase**
   - Applies decision tree logic to determine next action
   - Prioritizes tasks based on story development needs
   - Selects appropriate sub-agent for the work

3. **Execution Phase**
   - Delegates specific tasks to specialized sub-agents
   - Provides complete, self-contained instructions
   - Receives detailed outputs and summaries

4. **Integration Phase**
   - Saves generated content to appropriate files
   - Updates progress tracking and state files
   - Maintains consistency across all elements

5. **Validation Phase**
   - Checks for errors or inconsistencies
   - Applies quality standards verification
   - Prepares for next iteration

### What to Expect

- World-building foundation
- Magic system establishment
- Opening scenes generation

#### Phase 2: Story Development (Chapters 4-15)

- Climax preparation

#### Phase 4: Resolution (Chapters 26-30)
- Climactic confrontations
- Character arc completion
- Subplot resolution
- World state resolution
- Satisfying conclusion

## üõ†Ô∏è System Configuration

### Modifying Generation Parameters

You can customize the novel generation by editing configuration files:

#### Target Length Adjustment
Edit `planning/plot-progress.json`:
```json
{
  "target_words": 80000,  // Modify for shorter/longer novel
  "current_chapter": 1,
  // ... other settings
}
```

#### Quality Standards
Edit the sub-agent configuration files in `.claude/agents/`:
- **Chapter length**: Modify word count targets in agent instructions
- **Dialogue ratio**: Adjust dialogue requirements in scene-writer.md
- **Pacing**: Modify tension and rhythm requirements in plot-architect.md

#### Genre Customization
While optimized for fantasy, you can adapt the system:
- Modify worldbuilder.md for different settings (sci-fi, historical, etc.)
- Adjust character-developer.md for genre-appropriate archetypes
- Update scene-writer.md for genre-specific elements

### Advanced Configuration

#### Hook Customization
Edit `.claude/settings.json` to modify system behavior:
- Change reminder frequency
- Modify restart behavior
- Adjust context injection patterns

#### Agent Specialization
Create custom sub-agents by:
1. Copying an existing agent configuration
2. Modifying capabilities and instructions
3. Adding to `.claude/agents/` directory
4. Updating master orchestrator references

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### System Doesn't Start
**Symptoms**: No generation begins after launch command
**Solutions**:
- Verify `CLAUDE.md` exists and is properly formatted
- Check that all sub-agent files are in `.claude/agents/`
- Ensure launch script completed successfully
- Try manual initialization: `./launch-novel.sh`

#### Generation Stops Unexpectedly
**Symptoms**: System stops generating content mid-novel
**Solutions**:
- System includes auto-restart hooks, should resume automatically
- Manual restart: `claude --continue --dangerously-skip-permissions`
- Check `.claude/context-injection.txt` for system reminders
- Verify no file system issues or permission problems

#### Inconsistency Issues
**Symptoms**: Character or world contradictions in the text
**Solutions**:
- Continuity editor runs automatically every 3 chapters
- Manual consistency check: Review `/planning/` files
- Force continuity review by deleting last few chapters and regenerating
- Check world-state.json and character-knowledge.json for accuracy

#### Low Quality Output
**Symptoms**: Generated content doesn't meet expectations
**Solutions**:
- Review quality standards in sub-agent configurations
- Ensure word count targets are appropriate
- Check that progress tracking is accurate
- Consider modifying agent instructions for higher standards

#### Performance Issues
**Symptoms**: Very slow generation or high resource usage
**Solutions**:
- Reduce monitoring frequency
- Close unnecessary applications
- Ensure adequate system resources
- Consider reducing simultaneous background processes

### File System Issues

#### Missing Files
If critical files are missing:
```bash
# Recreate directory structure
mkdir -p .claude/agents manuscript/chapters planning worldbuilding characters automation

# Regenerate initialization files
./launch-novel.sh
```

#### Corrupted Progress Files
If progress tracking appears corrupted:
```bash
# Reset progress (will restart novel)
./launch-novel.sh

# Or manually edit JSON files in planning/ directory
```

#### Permission Problems
If you encounter permission errors:
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x launch-novel.sh automation/dashboard.py

# Check directory permissions
ls -la .claude/
```

### Advanced Troubleshooting

#### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by adding debug flags:
```bash
claude --continue --dangerously-skip-permissions --verbose
```

#### Manual State Inspection
Examine system state manually:
```bash
# Check current progress
cat planning/plot-progress.json | python3 -m json.tool

# Review chapter status
cat planning/chapter-status.json | python3 -m json.tool

# Examine world state
cat worldbuilding/world-state.json | python3 -m json.tool
```

#### Recovery Procedures
If the system becomes unstable:
1. Stop the current session
2. Back up any generated content
3. Run initialization script: `./launch-novel.sh`
4. Manually restore progress state if needed
5. Restart generation

## üìà Optimization Tips
