# Fantasy Novel Writing System v3.0

## 🚀 Autonomous Novel Generation Platform

The Fantasy Novel Writing System v3.0 is an architecturally optimized autonomous writing platform that generates complete 100,000-word fantasy novels with zero human intervention. Built using Claude Code best practices, it leverages specialized sub-agents and reinforcement learning to create consistent, high-quality fiction.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Design Principles

1. **Repeated Reinforcement**: Critical workflows reinforced multiple times throughout the system
2. **Natural Language Workflows**: Flexible control flow using descriptive instructions
3. **XML-Structured Prompts**: Semantic clarity through structured markup
4. **Self-Contained Sub-Agent Architecture**: Isolated, specialized agents for specific tasks
5. **System Reminder Re-injection**: Continuous alignment through contextual reminders

### Master Orchestrator

The system centers around a **Master Orchestrator** (`CLAUDE.md`) that:
- Continuously assesses story progress
- Determines next logical actions
- Delegates work to specialized sub-agents
- Maintains state and consistency
- Never stops until novel completion

### Specialized Sub-Agents

#### 🎭 Scene Writer (`scene-writer.md`)
- Creates immersive, sensory-rich narrative prose
- Specializes in dialogue, action, and emotional resonance
- Targets 500-1500 words per scene
- Returns complete, manuscript-ready content

#### 🏛️ Plot Architect (`plot-architect.md`)
- Structures compelling narratives with proper pacing
- Manages subplots and story threads
- Creates detailed chapter outlines
- Balances action, character development, and world-building

#### 🌍 Worldbuilder (`worldbuilder.md`)
- Creates consistent, detailed fantasy settings
- Designs magic systems, cultures, and histories
- Ensures internal logic and authenticity
- Provides plot hooks and story opportunities

#### 👥 Character Developer (`character-developer.md`)
- Builds psychologically complex characters
- Creates authentic voices and compelling arcs
- Manages character relationships and growth
- Ensures consistent personality development

#### ✅ Continuity Editor (`continuity-editor.md`)
- Maintains consistency across all story elements
- Tracks timeline, character knowledge, and world rules
- Identifies and resolves contradictions
- Provides specific correction instructions

## 🔧 System Components

### Automated Hooks (`.claude/settings.json`)
- **PostToolUse**: Injects reminders after task completion
- **SessionStart**: Initializes system state on startup
- **Stop**: Prevents system halting, maintains continuous generation

### State Management
- **Progress Tracking**: `/planning/plot-progress.json`
- **Chapter Status**: `/planning/chapter-status.json`
- **World State**: `/worldbuilding/world-state.json`
- **Character Knowledge**: `/characters/character-knowledge.json`

### Monitoring Tools
- **Dashboard**: `automation/dashboard.py` - Real-time progress monitoring

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/forsonny/Claude-Code-Novel-Writer.git
cd Claude-Code-Novel-Writer
```

### 2. Start Novel Generation
```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --continue
```

### 3. Monitor Progress (Optional)
```bash
python3 automation/dashboard.py --monitor
```

## 📊 Quality Standards

### Automatic Quality Maintenance
- **Chapter Length**: 3000-5000 words
- **Scene Length**: 500-1500 words
- **Dialogue Ratio**: 30-40% of content
- **Sensory Details**: Every 100 words
- **Chapter Endings**: Always include hooks
- **Consistency Checks**: Every 3 chapters

### Story Structure Targets
- **Act I**: Setup (25% - Chapters 1-7)
- **Act II**: Confrontation (50% - Chapters 8-22)  
- **Act III**: Resolution (25% - Chapters 23-30)

## 🎯 Key Features

- Self-correcting error handling
- Continuous generation until completion
- Automatic quality maintenance

### 🧠 Intelligent Sub-Agent Delegation

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Task Tool Usage
The system's primary mechanism is the `task` tool, which delegates work to sub-agents:

```
Tool: task
Agent: scene-writer
Instructions: "Write the opening scene of Chapter 5..."
```

### Workflow Loop
```pseudocode
while (novel_not_complete) {
    state = Read("/planning/plot-progress.json")
    next_action = determine_next_action(state)
    result = task(appropriate_agent, detailed_instructions)
    Write(output_file, result)
    update_progress(state)
    continue
}
```

### Error Recovery
- Automatic issue detection and correction
- Alternative approach selection when stuck
- Continuous progress without human intervention
- Self-healing system architecture

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### System Not Starting
- Verify all configuration files are present
- Check `.claude/agents/` directory has all sub-agent files
- Ensure proper file permissions are set

### Generation Stops
- System includes auto-restart hooks to prevent stopping
- Check `.claude/context-injection.txt` for system reminders
- Manual restart: `claude --continue --dangerously-skip-permissions`

### Consistency Issues
- Continuity editor runs every 3 chapters automatically
- Manual consistency check: Task continuity-editor with specific concerns
- Review `/planning/` files for tracking accuracy

### Low Quality Output
- Review quality standards in sub-agent configurations
- Ensure word count targets are appropriate
- Check that progress tracking is accurate
- Consider modifying agent instructions for higher standards

### Performance Issues
- Reduce monitoring frequency
- Close unnecessary applications
- Ensure adequate system resources
- Consider reducing simultaneous background processes

### File System Issues

#### Missing Files
If critical files are missing:
```bash
# Recreate directory structure
mkdir -p .claude/agents manuscript/chapters planning worldbuilding characters automation
```

#### Corrupted Progress Files
If progress tracking appears corrupted:
```bash
# Reset progress (will restart novel)
# Manually edit JSON files in planning/ directory
```

#### Permission Problems
If you encounter permission errors:
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x automation/dashboard.py
```

### Advanced Troubleshooting

#### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by adding debug flags:
```bash
claude --continue --dangerously-skip-permissions --verbose
```

#### Manual State Inspection
Examine system state manually:
```bash
# Check current progress
cat planning/plot-progress.json | python3 -m json.tool

# Review chapter status
cat planning/chapter-status.json | python3 -m json.tool

# Examine world state
cat worldbuilding/world-state.json | python3 -m json.tool
```

#### Recovery Procedures
If the system becomes unstable:
1. Stop the current session
2. Back up any generated content
3. Manually restore progress state if needed
4. Restart generation
